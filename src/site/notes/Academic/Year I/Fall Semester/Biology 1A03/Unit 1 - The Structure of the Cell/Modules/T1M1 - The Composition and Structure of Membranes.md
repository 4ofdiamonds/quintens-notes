# Unit 1 | Cells in our body:
## Consider this: You are never alone!
- There are an estimated 10x the amount of Prokaryotic Cells than Eukaryotic cells in the human body
## Human Microbiome
- **Microbiome:** A population of microorganisms microbes
	- There are estimated 10,000 species of microbes that healthy individuals may host
- Examples
	- **Streptococcus Salivarius:** A normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity
	- **Staphylococcus haemolyticus**: Resides on our skin
	- **Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron**: Is predominant intestinal bacteria
# Unit 2 | Phospholipids are the building blocks of membranes:
## Cell
### Definition
- Cell: a membrane bound structure containing macromolecules
- A cell must be able to separate the outside environment from the inside. This allows them to have distinct environment to have different chemical compositions
- The membrane is made of [[Academic/Grade 12/Semester 1/SBI4U0/Unit 2 - Metabolism/2.1 The Cell Membrane\|phospholipids]]
## Lipids in the cells
- Normally 16 to 18 carbons in a chain and can be saturated and unsaturated
- Changes in length and saturation affect the behavior of phospholipids and ultimately the membrane
# Unit 3 | Organization of Cell Membranes
## Phospholipids spontaneously adopt membrane structures
- Water molecules interact with the head regions, but not the tails of phospholipids which allows them to from spontaneously ==without any energy==
- Along with bilayers, micelles can form which is important in the absorption of fat soluble vitamins and complex lipids in the human body
## Cell membranes are fluid
- Phospholipids can ==move laterally== within the cell layer but ==not easily flip== from one side of the other without a great deal of energy
## Many factors influence the fluidity of cell membranes
- **Unsaturated vs Saturated**: Unsaturated (double bonds) push away neighboring phospholipids and increase fluidity and permeability
- **The number of carbons**: Shorter chains pack not as well as longer chains and increase fluidity
- **Temperatures**: Higher temperatures promote fluidity. Cold adapted cells have more unsaturated phospholipids to maintain fluidity
- **Cholesterol**: 
	- Make up around 50% of the membrane. 
	- Cholesterol reduces fluidity as without cholesterol the membrane would be to fluid. It does this by packing closely to phospholipids (acts as an anchor). 
	- At low temperatures cholesterol helps to stop the membrane from freezing and instead increases fluidity.
## Membrane Fluidity in Action
- Within the membrane and the cell there are certain domains which are more or less fluid
- **Lipids raft**: A region of lower fluidity phospholipids which can sequester or hold macromolecules together in the membrane. They often gather similar proteins in the same metabolic pathways or receptors on the surface of the cell
	- The lipid raft appears to stick out of the membrane because it has ==longer phospholipid tails, a higher concentration of cholesterol and saturated== so that way the molecules can pack together tighter.
	- Lipids rafts can form and disform depending on when it is needed
## Fluidity changes the permeability of membranes
- **Lower Permeability**: Lower Fluidity, Highly saturated and lots of cholesterol
- **Higher Permeability**: Higher Fluidity, Highly unsaturated and less cholesterol

## The Fluid Mosaic Model

**The Fluid Mosaic Model**: Membranes consist of proteins and carbohydrates embedded in a fluid bilayer. An emphasis on the ability of membrane components to be able to move laterally

# Unit 5 | Mechanisms of Transport Across the Cell Membrane
## Types of Transport
- [[Academic/Grade 12/Semester 1/SBI4U0/Unit 2 - Metabolism/2.1 The Cell Membrane\|Movement Across the Membrane]]
- **Aquaporins**: 
	- Aquaporins are exclusively permeable to water. 
	- Protein channels allow water to cross the membrane through osmosis and 10x the speed through the membrane. 
	- Movement is still determined by concentration gradient 
- **Primary Active Transport**: Direct expenditure of ATP to create a conformational change in a protein pump
- **Secondary Active Transport**: Utilizes the concentration change of Primary Active Transport to cross other molecules across the membrane
