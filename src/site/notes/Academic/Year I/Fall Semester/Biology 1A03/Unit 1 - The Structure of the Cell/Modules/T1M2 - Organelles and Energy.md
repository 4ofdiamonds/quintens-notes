# Unit 1 | Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes
## Life and photosynthesis began
- The introduction of photosynthesis allowed for the development of life and multicellular organisms
- The first photosynthetic cells came around in the Proterozoic Eons
## Eukaryotic vs Prokaryotic
- **Eukaryotic**: An organism with a genetic information trapped in a double membrane nucleus, and membrane bound organelles
- **Prokaryotic**: An organism with few organelles with free floating genetic material
- They shared a common ancestor but a major split happened when the mitochondria was first introduced
# Unit 2 | The evolution of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria
## Chloroplasts manufacture sugar
- **Photosynthesis**: A process by which plant cells and other organism convert light energy to chemical energy. This energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules
# Unit 3 | Evidence Supporting Endosymbiosis
## Endosymbiosis in Action
- Algae is an example of protists and bacteria working together in endosymbiosis. This is through the process of the Phagocytosis of the early eukaryote (protists) of the prokaryote (bacteria)
- Corals have a similar example
- Sea slugs can eat algae and maintain the chloroplasts
## Endosymbiotic Theory
- The endosymbiosis must become permanent and heritable 
- This is evident in the genomes found in chloroplasts and mitochondria
## Why are organelles important
- Compartmentalization allows for highly specific functions within the cell kept very close to each other
- More membranes increase membrane bound metabolic pathways
# Unit 4 | Cellular Respiration
## How does energy flow in biological systems

## Chloroplasts make chemical energy

$$6CO_{2}+12H_{2}O+\text{light energy}\to C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}+H_{2}O+6O_{2}$$
## Mitochondria

- Carbohydrates are metabolized first
- Fats second
- Proteins last
## ATP

- Exergonic Reaction (released energy)

- **Mechanical Work**: Contract a muscle
- **Transport Work**: Active Transport
- **Chemical Work** Building large molecules
