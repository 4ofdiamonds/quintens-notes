# Module 1
- **Fluidity**: The ability for parts of the membrane to move laterally
- **Permeability**: The ability for molecules to move across the membrane
## Visualizing lateral mobility in the cell membranes
- Tag protein channels within a membrane and shine a laser on top to see the fluidity of a membrane
- Additionally you can bleach the tags with a laser to turn off the florescent tags on the protein channels. If the membrane is fluid, then the membrane laterally move the dark tags around the membrane and there will no longer be a dark spot
- The endoplasmic reticulum is fluid because the proteins can move and this is evident from the recovery of bleached florescent tags on the membrane surface
- The nuclear membrane is not fluid because the exchange of signals and proteins needs to be reliable and
# Module 2
## Mitochondria
- PLANTS HAVE MITOCHONDRIA
- PLANTS JUST MAKE THEIR FOOD AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO FIND IT
## ETC
- Know the amount yields and inputs for each major step and ATP yield
