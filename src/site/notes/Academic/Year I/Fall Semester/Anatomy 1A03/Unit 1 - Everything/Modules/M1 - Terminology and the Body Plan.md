# Terminology and the Body Plan
## Hierarchy of the Body
- Atoms
- DNA
- Cells
- Tissues
- Organs
- Organ Systems
## Terminology
### Body Positions
- Anatomical Position: Body erect, face forward, feet together, palms facing forward
	- Left and right: Left and right is always their left and right
- Supine: Laying down face up
- Prone: Laying down face down
### Directional Terms
- **Superior (Cephalic)/Inferior (Caudal)**: Towards or Away from the **Head**
	- This is only used with structures in the head, neck and torso, and not limbs
	- Cephalic means towards the head
	- Caudal means towards the tail
- **Medial/Lateral**: Towards or away from the **Midline**
- **Proximal/Distal**: Closest or Farthest from the **Attachment Point**
- **Superficial/Deep**: Closest or Farthest from the **Surface of the Body**
- **Anterior (Ventral)/Posterior (Dorsal)**:  Towards the front or Towards the back
	- Ventral means towards belly
	- Dorsal means towards the back

### Body Planes
- **Sagittal**: Vertically into right and left sections
- **Frontal (Coronal)**: Vertically into anterior and posterior sections
- **Transverse**: Horizontally into Super and Inferior
- **Oblique**: Other than at a right angle
### Organ Planes
- **Longitudinal**: Cutting along the length
- **Cross/Transverse**: Cutting at a right angle to the length of the organ
- **Oblique**: Other than at a right angle
### Body Cavities
- **Dorsal Body Cavity**: Holds the Cranial Cavity and the Vertebral Canal (Holds the CNS)
- **Ventral Body Cavity**: Split in half by the diaphragm
	- **Upper Thoracic Cavity**: 
		- **Mediastinum**: Holds everything but the lungs. Heart, Esophagus, and Thymus gland
	- **Lower Abdominopelvic Cavity**: 
		- **Abdominal Cavity**: Contains the stomach, intestines, liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys
		- **Pelvic Cavity**: Contains urinary bladder, part of the large intestines, and reproductive organs
### Serous Membranes
- Cover the organs of trunk cavities and lines the cavities
- Think of squishing a water balloon so that your fist is surrounded by a double layer filled with water
- **Cavities**
	- **Visceral Serous Membrane**: Inner membrane (touching the organs)
	- **Parietal Serous Membrane**: Outer membrane (touching the cavity)
	- The Serous Membrane stops friction between organs and cavities to prevent damage over time
- **Organs**
	- **Pericardium**: Around the heart
	- **Pleura**: Around the lungs
	- **Peritoneum**: Around the organs of the abdominal Cavity
	- **Mesenteries**: Folds in the Serous membrane of the abdominal cavity which connects organs together (contains blood vessels and nerves)
- **Retroperitoneal Organs**: Behind the Serious membrane
