# Homeostasis
## Introduction
- **Set Point**: The variable that the body tends towards (ie internal temperature of 37)
- **Feedback System**

##  Feedback Loops
- **Negative Feedback Loop**: The goal of negative feedback loop is to make any deviation form the set point smaller
	- **Example**: Sweating

	- **Example**: Child Birth

## Changes in Homeostasis
- Changes in homeostasis and the set point can occur during something like exercise and blood pressure which is normal
- Consequences of Changes in Homeostasis
	- **Disease**
	- **Death**
