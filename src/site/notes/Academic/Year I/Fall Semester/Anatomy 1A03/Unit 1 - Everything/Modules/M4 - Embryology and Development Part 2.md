# Development of the Inner Mass
## Embryonic Disk
- **Embryonic Disk**: The middle part of the two cavities on top of each other where there is a double cell membrane
- **Epiblast Cells**: The wall cells of the top cavity of the Embryonic Disk which will the the cells that turn into the embryo. The bottom layer forms a double cell wall with the Hypoblast layer
- **Germ Layers**: Cell types that will turn into differentiate into different tissues
- **Hypoblast Layer**: The wall cells of the bottom cavity of the embryonic disk and will form extraembryonic tissues afterwards. The top layer forms a double cell wall with the Epiblast Cells
- **Bilaminar Embryonic Disk**: The Inner mass disk that has the two sections lying on top of each other
- **Amniotic Sac**: The wall of cells that will hold the embryo
- **Amniotic Cavity**: Fills with fluid to help the developing fetus and embryo
- **Yolk Sac**: It exists but just gets smaller and smaller

# Formation of Germ Layers
## Formation of Germ Layers (Day 13-14)
- **Gastrulation**: The process of turning the epiblast cells into the 3 germ layers
- The epiblast layer starts to lengthen and start to take shape similar to a human body (humans are longer than we are wide)
- **Primitive Streak**: While the epiblast cells are multiplying, halfway through the there becomes a thicker part of the embryotic disk
- The side that is away from the primitive streak is the cephalic end and the side that is closer to the primitive streak is the caudal end
- **Endoderm**: While the primitive streak is forming, epiblast cells start to move and displace the hypoblast cells to create a layer. (Dorsal Side)
	- This layer will form our digestive system, derivatives,  and lungs
- **Mesoderm**: Not all the cells make it all the way to the bottom and get stick between the Endoderm and what was the epiblast layer and turns into another layer
	- This layer will form the blood supply and bones and muscles
- **Ectoderm**: All the cells that don't move and stay where they are is the ectoderm layer (inside)
	- This layer will form most of the skin and nerves

## Formation of the Notochord (Day 16)
- **Notochord**: Is formed from mesodermal cells and becomes a solid cylinder right under the ectoderm layer and closer to the Cephalic end
- **Induction**: The Notochord will send signals to the ectoderm (above it) to create the neural plate
- **Neural Plate**: A thickened region of the ectoderm layer and is the most primitive form of the CNS
- **Oropharyngeal Membrane**: Thinner region on the Endoderm closer to the Cephalic head which will eventually become the mouth
- **Cloacal Membrane**: Thinner region on the Endoderm closer to the caudal region which will become the anus

# Formation of the Neural Tube and Somites
## Formation of Neural Tube (Day 18-26)
- 1) The Notochord sends the signal to create the neural plate and the place where it will be created starts to move. The lateral edges of the neural plate will start to fold into the **neural folds** and in the center indentation will be the **neural groove**
- 2) The neural folds will rise and the indentation will start to get larger. The top of the neural folds is called the **neural crest**
- 3) The crests of the folds will get closer and closer and the cells (**neural crest cells**) directly under the crest will break off
- 4) The neural crests have merged and pinched itself off creating a tube inside. The ==neural crest cells will break off and go to form other parts of your nervous system==. The inner tube known as the **neural tube** will start to become your spinal chord and brain
- While the neural tube is forming, the entire embryotic disk starts to ==fold right in the center of the ectoderm layer and folds to the caudal and cephalic== ends until there is a tube that runs the length of the embryo (ectoderm inside, endoderm outside)
- The rest of the ==ectoderm layer than didn't get folded in becomes the skin== of the fetus and wraps around the tube
- **Somites**: The somites form just outside the neural tube which are formed from the mesoderm layer just under the ectoderm layer
- **Neural Tube**: Forms the ==brain and spinal cord==
- **Neural Crest**: 
	- Sensory and post ganglionic autonomic portions of PNS
	- General connective tissue of the head

## Formation of Somite's 
- The somites form adjacent and bilaterally to the neural tube
- Will turn into our ==vertebral column, ribs and some skeletal muscle==
