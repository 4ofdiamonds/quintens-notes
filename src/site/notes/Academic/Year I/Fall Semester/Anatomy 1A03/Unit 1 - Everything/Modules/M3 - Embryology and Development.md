# Where it all began
## Where it all Began

![Pasted image 20250909183747.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909183747.png)
- The ovaries produce sex cells through ==meiosis==. These are called ==Oocyte==.
- ==14 days after mensurate== begins is when the Oocyte is released and ovulation begins
- Oocytes are not fully done meiosis and fully complete it once then enter into the ==Ampulla== (end of the ==Uterine tube or the Fallopian tube==) where fertilization actually takes place
- Once fertilization occurs, the zygote will travel down the Uterine tube and into the body of the uterus where the fetus will be developed
- The uterus is connected to the vagina through the ==cervix==
- Around 20 million sperm are released into the vagina but only 1% make it into the cervix. Around 100-200 sperm cells make it to the oocyte through the uterine tube
- The sperm is helped move along by peristaltic like contractions
## Prenatal Development
- From conception to birth:
	- **Germinal Period**: First 2 weeks of development; formation of primitive germ layers
	- **Embryonic Period**: Week 3 to end of 8th week; organ systems develop.
	- **Fetal period**: 9th Week until birth; organ systems grow and mature
## Terminology
- **Clinical events**: Date since last menstrual period (clinical age of unborn child)
	- This is not the most accurate because the last day of the menstrual cycle is still 2 weeks preovulation
- **Embryologists**: post-ovulatory age (approximately 14 days less than clinical age)
# Fertilization
## Fertilization Initial Steps
- The sperm will reach the ==secondary Oocyte== and will 
- **Zona Pellucida**: A glycoprotein layer surrounding the plasma membrane of the Oocyte
- **Corona Radiata**: Loosely packed follicular cells that surround the Zone Pellucida. Since the oocyte is matured in a follicle, upon exiting, the follicular cells will stay stuck into the Zona Pellucida

### Step 1
- **ZP3 Glycoprotein**: A species specific receptor which will trigger the release of Acrosomes in the sperm head
- Many sperm cells penetrate the corona radiata of the secondary oocyte. The Zona Pellucida has ZP3 Glycoprotein "sperm receptors" that are ==species specific==

### Step 2
- **Acrosome**: A collection of digestive enzymes in the head of the sperm which only activate upon contact of the ZP3 glycoprotein
- Acrosome of sperm binds to receptor causing an ==Acrosomal Reaction==. Leads to digestion of zona pellucida

### Step 3
- **Integrin A6B1**: A receptor on the plasma membrane of the oocyte which causes a fast depolarization of the membrane of the oocyte. The electrical change of the membrane will emit and electric shock to the other sperms to stop them from getting into the oocyte
- One sperm binds to integrin a6B1 (on oocyte plasma membrane) and causes depolarization (fast block to polyspermy). This sperm will enter the oocyte

#### What Stops multiple sperm
- **Fast Block to Polyspermy**: 
	- Depolarization
- **Slow Block to Polyspermy**: 
	- Intracellular release of Ca ions which causes a release of water, and the Ions and water are released into the space between the Zona Pellucida and the plasma membrane
	- This causes the Oocyte to shrink and for the Zona Pellucida to denature
	- Upon the denaturation the ZP3 Proteins will become inactive and the Zona Pellucida will become deactivated. 
	- Further sperm can no longer bind to the ZP3 receptor and the space between the oocyte and the Zona Pellucida stops further sperm from doing acrosomal reactions
### Step 4
- Female nucleus undergoes second meiotic division (forms ovum and second polar body).

### Step 5
- Female pronucleus and male pronucleus form
![Pasted image 20250909205647.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909205647.png)
### Step 6
- Fusion of haploid pronuclei produces single nucleus - zygote (diploid)
![Pasted image 20250909205727.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909205727.png)
## Morula and Blastocyst
- Each day the zygote will divide until day 5 when the zygote will have 12+ cells. 
- **Blastocyst**: The cells will secrete fluid into the cell and push all the cells to create a single cell layer wall where the Zona Pellucida was. 
- **Trophoblast Layer**: The outer layer of cells of the Blastocyst which will then later turn into the placenta and extraembryonic cells
- **Blastocele**: The inside of the blastocyst which houses the inner cell mass which will turn into the embryo
- During this process the cell will move closer to the uterine cavity and the blastocyst will implant itself into the uterine wall
![Pasted image 20250909210643.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909210643.png)
### Extras 
- So far the zygote has been relying on its own nutrients to get back and uterine milk which is rich in glycogen
- **Totipotent**: When a cell is able to turn into any other cell in the body. All cells up until the morula are totipotent
- **Pluripotent**: They can still form many types of cells, just not all the cells
# Implantation
## Implantation and Formation of Placenta
- **Uterine Endometrium**: The wall closest to the Uterine Cavity. This is the layer that changes in thickness with each menstrual cycle. By the time Implantation occurs it is very thick and very vascular
- The Blastocyst will orient the cellular mass towards the Endometrial when it attaches (Day 7)
### Day 8-12
- **Embryo Proper**: The cells that will develop into the embryo
- **Syncyiotrophoblasts cells**: 
	- Trophoblast cells closest to the Endometrial wall invade into the uterine wall and digest some of the blood cells found in the Endometrial wall to create a connection to the growing embryo. 
	- Upon entering the wall they will loose their membranes and become a large multinuclei mass. 
	- They also release a hormone known as human chorionic gonadotropin intio the maternal blood supply
	- This hormone prevents the wall from shedding and is also the hormone tested for in pregnancy tests
- **Cytotrophoblast cells**: Stay close to the embryo proper and provide a layer of separation between the maternal blood supply
![Pasted image 20250909212545.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909212545.png)
### Day 14-20
- The Blastocyst has fully be absorbed into the uterine wall and there is also a connecting stalk which connects to the developing embryo which will eventually become the umbilical chord
- The Syncyiotrophoblasts continue to digest the uterine endometrial, and the Cytotrophoblast also grow finger like projections
- **Lacuna**: Pools of maternal blood which are a byproduct of the digestion of the endometrial wall. These act as the supply of nutrients and oxygen
![Pasted image 20250909212958.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909212958.png)
### 1 month
- **Cytotrophoblast cords**: Start to surround the Syncyiotrophoblasts and the lacuna that are on the maternal side and creates a barrier between the maternal blood and the developing embryonic blood
- At this stage the embryo is starting to builds its own blood and the important thing is that the maternal and embryonic blood do not mix
- **Mesoderm cells**: Build blood and blood vessels on the embryo side
![Pasted image 20250909213515.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250909213515.png)
## Mature Placenta and Fetus
- **Chorionic Villi**: Bloods vessels which fill in the inside of the Cytotrophoblast chords
- On the maternal side there is a giant lacuna which surround the Chorionic Villi separated by the Cytotrophoblast chords but have high surface area to diffuse gases and nutrients
- **Umbilical Arteries and Veins**: The deoxygenated blood is brought through the arteries (away from the heart) and into the Chorionic Villi where the veins will bring the oxygenated blood back to the heart
- **Chorion**: A barrier between the villi and the maternal blood made of the remaining Syncyiotrophoblast cells and a thin basement membrane made of protein fibres. The Cytotrophoblast cells have disintegrated and they are just left with the Syncyiotrophoblast cells
