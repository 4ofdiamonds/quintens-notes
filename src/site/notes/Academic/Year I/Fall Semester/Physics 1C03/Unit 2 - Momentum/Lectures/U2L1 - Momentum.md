## SI Units
- The inertia of an object is represented by the symbol m:
	- m is for mass, a concept related to inertia
- The basic SI unit of inertia is the kilogram (kg)
	- The inertial standard was a platinum-iridium cylinder stored at the international Bureau of weights and Measure in france
	- Updated definition of kilogram in 2018
## Choosing a System
- Classify physical situations as being composed of a system of objects of interest and the rest of the universe, the environment
- **System**: Any object depends on what we're interested in finding out. Once we choose our system, we can study how quantities associated with the system change over time
	- **Extensive Quantities**: Quantities whose value is proportional to the size of the system
	- **Intensive Quantities**: Quantities that do not depend on the extent of the system
## Ways to change Extensive Quantities
- Park Example: We're interested in the number of trees and how this changes in time
- How can we change the number of trees in the park?
	- 1. Cut down/move - External
	- 2. Plant trees - External
	- 3. Trees die - Internal
	- 4. Trees grow - Internal
- **Net Effect**: $\Delta N=\Delta N_{\text{in}}+\Delta N_{\text{out}}+\Delta N_{\text{destroyed}}+\Delta N_{\text{created}}$
- Only four processes change the value of an extensive quantity: Input, Output, Creation, Destruction
- Then, the change of a certain quantity over a time interval is given by
$$\begin{align}
\text{change = input-output+creation-destruction}
\end{align}$$

- If there is no transfer of an extensive quantity under consideration across the boundary of the system, then
$$\begin{align}
\text{change = creation-destruction}
\end{align}$$
- Any extensive quantity that cannot be created or destroyed is said to be conserved: 
	- The change in the value of a conserved quantity is
$$\begin{align}
\text{change=input-output}
\end{align}$$

## Collisions Between Two Identical Carts
- Magnet-Magnet Interaction
- How do the velocities of the two carts change when a collision occurs?
	- Velocities interchange
- Moving cart collides with stationary cart:

- What if both carts were moving initially?
	- Velocities still interchange
![Pasted image 20250915100447.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Pasted%20image%2020250915100447.png)
- What is the change in the velocity of Cart 1? What is the change in velocity of Cart 2? How are they related?
## Collisions between two non-identical carts
- What if the carts have different masses?
	- Change in v is proportional to 1/m as m increases, v decreases

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta v_{d}}{\Delta v_{s}} & =-\frac{m_{s}}{m_{d}}
\end{align}$$
